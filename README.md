# rock-paper-scissors


## What the project is about

This project lets you play Rock, Paper or Scissors! on your console, where you will play against the
computer which will randomly generate a choice among the three and compete against you!

## What I have learnt and implemented

I learnt how to write basic javascript programs and function, debugging javascript programs and using the console
for the all the above things.
I learnt how to handle events on the page and modifying html elements from JavaScript.

## What could be improved here

The random number generator I have used is not entirely random and so that can be improved by having a better random number
generator.
